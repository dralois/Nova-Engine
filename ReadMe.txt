First and foremost, this is a hobby project.
It's mostly a game, however based on my own engine.
The code is a mix of C++ and HLSL, using DirectX.
Everything needed to build the game should be included,
feel free to download and play if you'd like to.

Controls:
Hotkey 'C' activates/deactivates movement
Hotkey 'R' fires the gatling gun
Hotkey 'F' fires the plasma gun
